# PENGUIN_PROJECJ
Penguin CSS Art Welcome to Penguin CSS Art, a playful and responsive web illustration built entirely with HTML and CSS. This project showcases how pure CSS can be used to craft charming characters and scenic environments—no images, no JavaScript, just code and creativity.  🌟 What’s Inside This project features:  A stylized penguin character with animated waving arms, expressive eyes, blush cheeks, and a custom “I 💜 CSS” shirt.  A scenic background including a sun, layered mountains, and icy ground—all created with gradients and transforms.  Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes using viewport settings.  Interactive behavior: click the penguin to see it scale up with a fun transformation.  🧠 Why It Matters This project is perfect for:  Learning CSS fundamentals like positioning, gradients, animations, and pseudo-elements.  Exploring creative coding through visual storytelling and character design.  Teaching others how to build art with semantic HTML and reusable CSS variables.  🎨 Technologies Used HTML5: Semantic structure and accessibility-friendly markup.  CSS3: Variables, gradients, transforms, animations, and layering techniques.  📁 File Structure plaintext ├── index.html       # Main HTML file with semantic structure and comments ├── styles.css       # External CSS file with themed variables and detailed styling └── README.md        # Project overview and documentation 🚀 How to Run Clone the repository:  bash git clone https://github.com/your-username/penguin-css-art.git Open index.html in your browser.
